# Donation Tracker for Causes

## 📌 Project Description
This project aims to create a blockchain-based platform where users can buy, sell, and auction digital art as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens). A percentage of the transaction proceeds will be automatically donated to a specified cause, ensuring transparency and accountability through the smart contract.
